  * start    => number of days ago to start (defaults to 1, i.e. yesterday)
  * days     => number of days to summarize (defaults to 1)
  * project  => id or identifier of project (defaults to all projects that are enabled)

Example:
  rake redmine:send_digest days=7 RAILS_ENV="production"

require 'rake'
require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../../../../config/environment")
#require "mailer"
#require "digestmailer"

namespace :redmine do
	task :send_digest, :environment, :project, :start, :days, :debugging_messages do |t, args|
		options = {}
		args.with_defaults(:project => nil, :start => nil, :days => nil, :environment => "production")
		ENV['environment'] = args[:environment]
		options[:project] = ENV['project'] if (ENV['project'] || args[:project])
